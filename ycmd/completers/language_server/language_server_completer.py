    Abstract language server communication object.

    This connection runs as a thread and is generally only used directly by
    LanguageServerCompleter, but is instantiated, startd and stopped by Concrete
    LanguageServerCompleter implementations.

    Implementations of this class are required to provide the following methods:
      - _TryServerConnectionBlocking: Connect to the server and return when the
                                      connection is established
      - Close: Close any sockets or channels prior to the thread exit
      - _Write: Write some data to the server
      - _Read: Read some data from the server, blocking until some data is
               available

    Using this class in concrete LanguageServerCompleter implementations:

    Startup

    - Call start() and AwaitServerConnection()
    - AwaitServerConnection() throws LanguageServerConnectionTimeout if the
      server fails to connect in a reasonable time.

    Shutdown

    - Call stop() prior to shutting down the downstream server (see
      LanguageServerCompleter.ShutdownServer to do that part)
    - Call Close() to close any remaining streams. Do this in a request thread.
      DO NOT CALL THIS FROM THE DISPATCH THREAD.

    Footnote: Why does this interface exist?

    Language servers are at liberty to provide their communication interface
    over any transport. Typically, this is either stdio or a socket (though some
    servers require multiple sockets). This interface abstracts the
    implementation detail of the communication from the transport, allowing
    concrete completers to choose the right transport according to the
    downstream server (i.e. whatever works best).

    If in doubt, use the StandardIOLanguageServerConnection as that is the
    simplest. Socket-based connections often require the server to connect back
    to us, which can lead to complexity and possibly blocking.
